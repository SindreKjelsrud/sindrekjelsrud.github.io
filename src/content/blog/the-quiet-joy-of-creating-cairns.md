There's something inherently meditative about stacking stones, one over the other, to create a cairn. It's such a simple thing that requires patience, focus, and a gentle touch, that's drawing you into the present moment. Each stone, with its unique shape and weight, challenges me to find its perfect place in the stack, creating this inner state of calm. The result is not "just" a stack of stones, but a representation of the builder's time and effort.

Whether it's by a beautiful lake or on a windswept hill, building cairns has become a way for me to just slow down. It makes me have this deep feeling of calm, You can say it's kinda like a reminder that even the simplest things can make you happy and content.  

You might have noticed that my website features a dedicated gallery to [**my cairn collection**](/gallery/cairns). This page showcases my creations before they are either dismantled or left alone to shine in it's dedicated spot. It's like a personal journal, capturing moments of joy experienced during each build.

Building cairns is more than a hobby for me; it's a practice that centers me. The process of selecting each stone, contemplating its placement, and witnessing the cairn come to life is a profound experience. It's an exercise in mindfulness, where the world falls away, leaving only the stone, the environment around, and me.

I hope to share this passion and perhaps inspire you to find your own zen in the art form of cairn building. Whether you're looking for a new way to connect with nature, a mindfulness practice, or simply a creative outlet, cairn building offers something unique. It's a reminder that beauty and peace can be constructed from the ground up, one stone at a time.
