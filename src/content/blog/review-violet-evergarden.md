Today I just finished binge-watching ***Violet Evergarden***, and the fact that I wanted to write a review right away says just how amazing this anime is. It's not often that an anime manages to capture the whole range of emotions through words, but this one did, and it absolutely melted my heart.

First off, let's talk about the emotional rollercoaster this anime puts you through. It makes you cry, laugh, and experience everything in between. There's something about the journey of understanding love and loss through Violet's eyes that just hits differently. The anime also shows how powerful words can be in the form of handwritten letters, which is something I feel has become a lost art in our fast-paced world.

Now, the aesthetics and animation? Simply just stunning. Every frame of this anime is a visual treat, from the super details on Violet's mechanical arms to the breathtaking landscapes.

Can I also just mention how good the sound design is? All of the subtle sounds that add depth and realism to the world, like Violet's foot hitting the dirt or the subtle movements of her mechanical arms. It makes everything so much more immersive!

In short, "Violet Evergarden" is a rare work of art that manages to touch a wide range of emotions in such a short period of time. This anime is a masterpiece. And yes, I can't wait to watch the movie next. 

> ***PS:** Hearing Violet read her letter to the Major was just beautiful. I got chills hearing her read it.*
